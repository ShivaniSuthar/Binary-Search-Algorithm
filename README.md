# Binary-Search-In-Python
## Project Summary:
I programmed the classic binary search algorithm using Python. The _Binary-Search file contains the implementation of the algorithm which computes a binary search
by taking in 4 parameters - target, arr, left, right where target is an element you are looking for, arr is the original list of numbers, left is the left  index
of the list you search through, and right is the right index of the list you search through.

Knowledge of the binary search algorithm and recursion were essential for completing this project.

Testing was done with doctests.
